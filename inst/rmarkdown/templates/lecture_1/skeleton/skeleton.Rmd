# Let's get started

-   What are the genetic algorithms (GAs)?

## Introduction to GAs

**Overview:** Genetic algorithms (GAs) are optimization methods inspired
by natural selection and genetics. They are used to solve optimization
problems by evolving a population of candidate solutions.

**Key concepts:**

-   **Population**: Set of possible solutions.
-   **Fitness**: A measure of how good each solution is.
-   **Selection**: Choosing individuals for reproduction.
-   **Crossover**: Combining parts of two solutions to create a new
    solution.
-   **Mutation**: Randomly altering a solution.

## Problem to solve

**Objective:** We aim to optimize the quadratic function
$f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$, minimizing the value of $f(x)$.

**Function:** $$
f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4
$$

## Initialize population

We begin by creating an initial population of three individuals:
$x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 3$, and $x_3 = 0$.

```{r initialization}
population <- c(1, 3, 0)
population
```

## Evaluate fitness

**Fitness function:** The fitness of an individual is how well it
minimizes the function $f(x)$.

For each individual, calculate $f(x)$: $$
f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4
$$

```{r define_function}
f <- function(x) {
    x^2 - 4*x + 4
}

# we calculate fitness
fitness <- f(population)
fitness
```

## Visualizing the **fitness function**

Let's plot the quadratic function $f(x)$ to visualize the optimization
landscape.

```{r visualization, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x <- seq(from = 0, to = 4, length.out = 100)
y <- f(x)

ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Quadratic function: f(x)", x = "x", y = "f(x)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Selection

We select individuals for crossover based on fitness. Lower fitness
values are better in this case, so we select $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 3$.

```{r selection}
# w select the parents with the best fitness (lowest values)
selected_parents <- population[order(fitness)][1:2]
selected_parents
```

## Crossover and mutation

**Crossover:** Combines the genes (values) of two parents to create
offspring.

**Mutation:** Introduces random changes to avoid local minima.

```{r}
# perform crossover (simple example: no change in this step)
offspring <- selected_parents

# introduce mutation with a small probability (no mutation for this example)
mutated_offspring <- offspring
mutated_offspring
```

## Replacement

We replace one of the individuals in the population with the offspring
to form a new population.

```{r}
# replace the least fit individual in the population with one of the offspring
new_population <- c(selected_parents, population[which.min(fitness)])
new_population
```

# Iteration and convergence

The process is repeated over multiple generations. The population
evolves over time, approaching the optimal solution, to eventually reach
it.

## Finding the optimal solution

**Theoretical optimal point:**

The minimum of the quadratic function occurs at: $$
x = \frac{-b}{2a} = 2
$$ The corresponding function value is $f(2) = 0$.

```{r}
# calculate the optimal point
optimal_x <- -(-4) / (2 * 1)
optimal_y <- f(optimal_x)
c(optimal_x, optimal_y)
```

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaways:**

-   Genetic algorithms can be applied to solve optimization problems.
-   Through selection, crossover, and mutation, a population evolves to
    find the optimal solution.
-   This approach is effective for problems where traditional
    optimization methods might struggle.

**Further Applications:**

-   Neural network optimization.
-   Solving NP-hard problems like the traveling salesman problem.
-   Automated design and engineering.
